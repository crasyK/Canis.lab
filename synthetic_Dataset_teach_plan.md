## Workflow

First I need to determine the Main Idea of making this dataset or dataset creation tool

Things like:
- What do I want to achieve
- Structure of the dataset. Like if there are any subgroups or is it all like one thing or are there like iterative subgroups
- What Format? Instructions? Conversations? Way of speech? Or smth else

For t.e.a.c.h.:

3 Subjects: Math, Englisch, History
    ⌞4 Classes each: 6;8;10;12 
        ⌞5 Topics each
            ⌞35 Conversations per Class and Topic -> 25 Training and 10 Testing 
                ⌞Generation: 35 Contexts -> 25 Full Conversations + 10 Testing Contexts

Datasets consists of either Conversation-Only Data or Context aided Conversation

3 Datasets: 
    context-Math; solo-Math
    context-English; solo-English
    context-History; solo-History
