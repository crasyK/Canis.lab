I'll use {teaching-techniques}\u2014I'll ask questions to guide you. Tell me: what is the first thing you notice about the problem?\n2) Student: It looks like I just need to multiply everything together, so I would multiply the main numbers and be done.\n3) Educator: Good observation about multiplication being involved, but before multiplying, what structure or relationship does the problem show? Can you point to one quantity that depends on another?\n4) Student: One quantity depends on the other because of a ratio... so I could set them equal and then multiply both sides.\n5) Educator: You're getting closer\u2014recognizing a dependency and using a ratio is helpful. Now try to write one short sentence that describes that dependency algebraically (use a letter for the unknown). I won't give the final answer, but I'll check your equation and tell you whether your setup follows logically.\n\nDialogue 2 (4 turns) \u2014 technique emphasis: visualization + analogy (I'll use {teaching-techniques})\n1) Educator: In {subject_key}, to understand {subject_value} let's picture it like a balance scale. Which side is heavier or changing when you adjust a variable?\n2) Student: If I change the variable on one side, the other side stays the same, so I'd just shift numbers across like normal and subtract.\n3) Educator: The balance analogy is useful, but be careful: in this setup both sides can change because of how the variables relate. Instead of moving numbers blindly, what operation preserves equality on both sides of an equation?\n4) Student: You mean I should add the same thing to both sides? Okay \u2014 I'll try adding and see whether that isolates the variable. (student's plan; not a final answer)\n\nDialogue 3 (6 turns) \u2014 technique emphasis: worked-example + error analysis (I'll use {teaching-techniques})\n1) Educator: Let's work through a similar example step by step (I will use {teaching-techniques} and then we analyze errors). I'll describe each step and you tell me if it makes sense.\n2) Student: Sounds good. For the first step, I'd combine like terms right away \u2014 that always simplifies things.\n3) Educator: Combining like terms is often right, but check whether the terms you want to combine actually share the same variable and power. Can you identify two terms here that are truly \"like\"?\n4) Student: Umm, I think 2x and 3 are like because they both appear in the expression. So I'd combine them into 5x.\n5) Educator: That's a common mistake\u20142x and 3 are not like terms because 3 has no x. Good catch that we need to analyze like terms carefully. Now rewrite the expression showing only the true like terms combined; write that as a short expression (I won't evaluate further).\n6) Student: Okay \u2014 I'll write the expression keeping x-terms together and constants together, and then try isolating the variable next."}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "dialogues", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"dialogue": {"type": "array", "description": "An array of dialogue sequences.

Tell me: what do you think {subject_value} is trying to measure in this {subject_key} problem?\nStudent: I think it measures the final number you get after doing all the steps \u2014 like the end result.\nEducator: That\u2019s an understandable guess. Let\u2019s break it down (scaffolding): what smaller idea or quantity could {subject_value} describe instead of \u201cthe final number\u201d? Try to name one related concept in {subject_key} that it might tie to.\nStudent: Maybe it\u2019s the middle value or the average of something?\nEducator: Good attempt \u2014 that shows you\u2019re thinking of a summary statistic. Now use {teaching-techniques} by drawing a simple mental sketch: imagine how the quantity changes when one input increases. Does your \u201caverage\u201d idea change smoothly or does it act like a rate or a fixed shift? Describe which behavior fits {subject_value} in {subject_key}, and we\u2019ll test that with one small calculation (I won\u2019t give the result).\n\nDialogue 2 (4 turns)\nEducator: I\u2019ll try {teaching-techniques} here: analogy plus worked-example thinking. Compare {subject_value} in {subject_key} to a familiar real-world process \u2014 can you pick one and describe the comparison briefly?\nStudent: Okay \u2014 maybe it\u2019s like filling a bucket: you add stuff until it\u2019s full.\nEducator: Nice analogy. Now think: when filling a bucket, what tells you how quickly it\u2019s filling \u2014 the bucket\u2019s capacity or the flow rate? Which corresponds to {subject_value} in {subject_key}?\nStudent: The capacity \u2014 so {subject_value} must be how much fits in total.\nEducator: That\u2019s a plausible mapping, but watch the analogy: \u201ccapacity\u201d is a total amount, while the thing that often matters in {subject_key} is how one quantity changes with another (the flow). Using {teaching-techniques}, let\u2019s set up a brief example problem together \u2014 I\u2019ll guide you through the steps and ask you to compute one intermediate quantity (don\u2019t give the final answer here).\n\nDialogue 3 (6 turns)\nEducator: I\u2019ll combine {teaching-techniques}: guided discovery + error analysis. We\u2019ll work through a short task in {subject_key} so you can see {subject_value} in action. First, what step would you try first when you face this kind of problem?\nStudent: I\u2019d just plug the numbers into the final formula straight away.\nEducator: That\u2019s a common impulse. Instead, try using guided discovery: what intermediate relationship should you check first before plugging numbers in? Name a relation or equation that connects the pieces.\nStudent: Maybe check if the variables are equal? Like set them equal and solve.\nEducator: That might be an unnecessary step depending on the context \u2014 good that you\u2019re thinking about relationships. Now do a targeted check: compute one simple intermediate expression (I\u2019ll tell you which) and tell me whether it increases or decreases when you change one input.
