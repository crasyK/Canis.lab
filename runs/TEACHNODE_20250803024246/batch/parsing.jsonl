I heard you\u2019re having some trouble with fractions. Can you tell me what you find confusing about them?\n\n**Student:** Yeah, I don\u2019t really get what a fraction is. I think it\u2019s just a number, like three over four?\n\n**Educator:** Good start! A fraction, like 3/4, does involve numbers. But can you think of what the numbers represent?\n\n**Student:** Uh, I think the top number is how many times you can count to four? \n\n**Educator:** Close! The top number, called the numerator, tells us how many parts we have. What do you think the bottom number, the denominator, means?\n\n**Student:** Maybe it\u2019s how many times you can count to three? \n\n**Educator:** Not quite! The denominator tells us how many equal parts the whole is divided into. Can you think of something we can divide into parts to visualize this better?\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 2: Comparing Fractions\n\n**Educator:** Hey! I see you\u2019re working on comparing fractions. What\u2019s been tricky for you?\n\n**Student:** I don\u2019t know. Sometimes I think 2/5 is bigger than 3/4, but I\u2019m not sure.\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s okay! Let\u2019s think about it together. What do you think it means for one fraction to be bigger than another?\n\n**Student:** I think it means the top number is bigger? Like, 3 is bigger than 2, so 3/4 is bigger than 2/5!\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s one way to look at it, but we also need to think about the whole! If we have a pizza divided into 4 slices and another pizza divided into 5 slices, which one do you think gives you bigger pieces?\n\n**Student:** Oh! I guess the 4 slices would be bigger pieces, so 3/4 would be bigger than 2/5!\n\n**Educator:** Exactly! So, if we compare them, can we say that 3/4 is indeed bigger than 2/5?\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 3: Adding Fractions with Like Denominators\n\n**Educator:** Hi! You\u2019re learning how to add fractions. What\u2019s been challenging for you?\n\n**Student:** I don\u2019t get why I can\u2019t just add the top numbers, like 1/4 plus 2/4 equals 3/4, right? \n\n**Educator:** You\u2019re on the right track with that! Adding the top numbers works well here. Can you tell me why we can do that with these fractions?\n\n**Student:** Um, because they\u2019re both four? So it\u2019s like adding two apples and one apple?\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s a great analogy! They\u2019re both parts of the same whole. What would happen if the denominators were different, like 1/3 and 1/4?\n\n**Student:** Uh, I think I can just add the top numbers again, so it would be 2/7? \n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s a common mistake! We need to find a common denominator first before we can add them.

Like, 3 is bigger than 2, so 3/4 is bigger than 2/5!\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s one way to look at it, but we also need to think about the whole! If we have a pizza divided into 4 slices and another pizza divided into 5 slices, which one do you think gives you bigger pieces?\n\n**Student:** Oh! I guess the 4 slices would be bigger pieces, so 3/4 would be bigger than 2/5!\n\n**Educator:** Exactly! So, if we compare them, can we say that 3/4 is indeed bigger than 2/5?\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 3: Adding Fractions with Like Denominators\n\n**Educator:** Hi!

Adding the top numbers works well here. Can you tell me why we can do that with these fractions?\n\n**Student:** Um, because they\u2019re both four? So it\u2019s like adding two apples and one apple?\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s a great analogy! They\u2019re both parts of the same whole. What would happen if the denominators were different, like 1/3 and 1/4?\n\n**Student:** Uh, I think I can just add the top numbers again, so it would be 2/7? \n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s a common mistake!

I heard you\u2019re having some trouble with fractions. Can you tell me what you find confusing about them?\n\n**Student:** Yeah, I don\u2019t really get what a fraction is. I think it\u2019s just a number, like three over four?\n\n**Educator:** Good start! A fraction, like 3/4, does involve numbers. But can you think of what the numbers represent?\n\n**Student:** Uh, I think the top number is how many times you can count to four? \n\n**Educator:** Close! The top number, called the numerator, tells us how many parts we have. What do you think the bottom number, the denominator, means?\n\n**Student:** Maybe it\u2019s how many times you can count to three? \n\n**Educator:** Not quite! The denominator tells us how many equal parts the whole is divided into.

Let\u2019s think about it together. What do you think it means for one fraction to be bigger than another?\n\n**Student:** I think it means the top number is bigger? Like, 3 is bigger than 2, so 3/4 is bigger than 2/5!\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s one way to look at it, but we also need to think about the whole! If we have a pizza divided into 4 slices and another pizza divided into 5 slices, which one do you think gives you bigger pieces?\n\n**Student:** Oh! I guess the 4 slices would be bigger pieces, so 3/4 would be bigger than 2/5!\n\n**Educator:** Exactly!

I heard you\u2019re having some trouble with fractions. Can you tell me what you find confusing about them?\n\n**Student:** Yeah, I don\u2019t really get what a fraction is. I think it\u2019s just a number, like three over four?\n\n**Educator:** Good start! A fraction, like 3/4, does involve numbers. But can you think of what the numbers represent?\n\n**Student:** Uh, I think the top number is how many times you can count to four? \n\n**Educator:** Close! The top number, called the numerator, tells us how many parts we have. What do you think the bottom number, the denominator, means?\n\n**Student:** Maybe it\u2019s how many times you can count to three? \n\n**Educator:** Not quite! The denominator tells us how many equal parts the whole is divided into. Can you think of something we can divide into parts to visualize this better?\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 2: Comparing Fractions\n\n**Educator:** Hey! I see you\u2019re working on comparing fractions. What\u2019s been tricky for you?\n\n**Student:** I don\u2019t know. Sometimes I think 2/5 is bigger than 3/4, but I\u2019m not sure.\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s okay! Let\u2019s think about it together. What do you think it means for one fraction to be bigger than another?\n\n**Student:** I think it means the top number is bigger? Like, 3 is bigger than 2, so 3/4 is bigger than 2/5!\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s one way to look at it, but we also need to think about the whole! If we have a pizza divided into 4 slices and another pizza divided into 5 slices, which one do you think gives you bigger pieces?\n\n**Student:** Oh! I guess the 4 slices would be bigger pieces, so 3/4 would be bigger than 2/5!\n\n**Educator:** Exactly! So, if we compare them, can we say that 3/4 is indeed bigger than 2/5?\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 3: Adding Fractions with Like Denominators\n\n**Educator:** Hi! You\u2019re learning how to add fractions.

Adding the top numbers works well here. Can you tell me why we can do that with these fractions?\n\n**Student:** Um, because they\u2019re both four? So it\u2019s like adding two apples and one apple?\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s a great analogy! They\u2019re both parts of the same whole. What would happen if the denominators were different, like 1/3 and 1/4?\n\n**Student:** Uh, I think I can just add the top numbers again, so it would be 2/7? \n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s a common mistake!

Can you think of something we can divide into parts to visualize this better?\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 2: Comparing Fractions\n\n**Educator:** Hey! I see you\u2019re working on comparing fractions. What\u2019s been tricky for you?\n\n**Student:** I don\u2019t know. Sometimes I think 2/5 is bigger than 3/4, but I\u2019m not sure.\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s okay! Let\u2019s think about it together. What do you think it means for one fraction to be bigger than another?\n\n**Student:** I think it means the top number is bigger? Like, 3 is bigger than 2, so 3/4 is bigger than 2/5!\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s one way to look at it, but we also need to think about the whole! If we have a pizza divided into 4 slices and another pizza divided into 5 slices, which one do you think gives you bigger pieces?\n\n**Student:** Oh! I guess the 4 slices would be bigger pieces, so 3/4 would be bigger than 2/5!\n\n**Educator:** Exactly! So, if we compare them, can we say that 3/4 is indeed bigger than 2/5?\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 3: Adding Fractions with Like Denominators\n\n**Educator:** Hi! You\u2019re learning how to add fractions. What\u2019s been challenging for you?\n\n**Student:** I don\u2019t get why I can\u2019t just add the top numbers, like 1/4 plus 2/4 equals 3/4, right? \n\n**Educator:** You\u2019re on the right track with that! Adding the top numbers works well here. Can you tell me why we can do that with these fractions?\n\n**Student:** Um, because they\u2019re both four? So it\u2019s like adding two apples and one apple?\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s a great analogy! They\u2019re both parts of the same whole. What would happen if the denominators were different, like 1/3 and 1/4?\n\n**Student:** Uh, I think I can just add the top numbers again, so it would be 2/7? \n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s a common mistake!

Adding the top numbers works well here. Can you tell me why we can do that with these fractions?\n\n**Student:** Um, because they\u2019re both four? So it\u2019s like adding two apples and one apple?\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s a great analogy! They\u2019re both parts of the same whole. What would happen if the denominators were different, like 1/3 and 1/4?\n\n**Student:** Uh, I think I can just add the top numbers again, so it would be 2/7? \n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s a common mistake!

I heard you\u2019re having some trouble with fractions. Can you tell me what you find confusing about them?\n\n**Student:** Yeah, I don\u2019t really get what a fraction is. I think it\u2019s just a number, like three over four?\n\n**Educator:** Good start! A fraction, like 3/4, does involve numbers. But can you think of what the numbers represent?\n\n**Student:** Uh, I think the top number is how many times you can count to four? \n\n**Educator:** Close! The top number, called the numerator, tells us how many parts we have. What do you think the bottom number, the denominator, means?\n\n**Student:** Maybe it\u2019s how many times you can count to three? \n\n**Educator:** Not quite! The denominator tells us how many equal parts the whole is divided into.

Let\u2019s think about it together. What do you think it means for one fraction to be bigger than another?\n\n**Student:** I think it means the top number is bigger? Like, 3 is bigger than 2, so 3/4 is bigger than 2/5!\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s one way to look at it, but we also need to think about the whole! If we have a pizza divided into 4 slices and another pizza divided into 5 slices, which one do you think gives you bigger pieces?\n\n**Student:** Oh! I guess the 4 slices would be bigger pieces, so 3/4 would be bigger than 2/5!\n\n**Educator:** Exactly! So, if we compare them, can we say that 3/4 is indeed bigger than 2/5?\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 3: Adding Fractions with Like Denominators\n\n**Educator:** Hi!

I heard you\u2019re having some trouble with fractions. Can you tell me what you find confusing about them?\n\n**Student:** Yeah, I don\u2019t really get what a fraction is. I think it\u2019s just a number, like three over four?\n\n**Educator:** Good start! A fraction, like 3/4, does involve numbers. But can you think of what the numbers represent?\n\n**Student:** Uh, I think the top number is how many times you can count to four? \n\n**Educator:** Close! The top number, called the numerator, tells us how many parts we have. What do you think the bottom number, the denominator, means?\n\n**Student:** Maybe it\u2019s how many times you can count to three? \n\n**Educator:** Not quite! The denominator tells us how many equal parts the whole is divided into. Can you think of something we can divide into parts to visualize this better?\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 2: Comparing Fractions\n\n**Educator:** Hey! I see you\u2019re working on comparing fractions. What\u2019s been tricky for you?\n\n**Student:** I don\u2019t know. Sometimes I think 2/5 is bigger than 3/4, but I\u2019m not sure.\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s okay! Let\u2019s think about it together. What do you think it means for one fraction to be bigger than another?\n\n**Student:** I think it means the top number is bigger? Like, 3 is bigger than 2, so 3/4 is bigger than 2/5!\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s one way to look at it, but we also need to think about the whole! If we have a pizza divided into 4 slices and another pizza divided into 5 slices, which one do you think gives you bigger pieces?\n\n**Student:** Oh! I guess the 4 slices would be bigger pieces, so 3/4 would be bigger than 2/5!\n\n**Educator:** Exactly! So, if we compare them, can we say that 3/4 is indeed bigger than 2/5?\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 3: Adding Fractions with Like Denominators\n\n**Educator:** Hi! You\u2019re learning how to add fractions.

Adding the top numbers works well here. Can you tell me why we can do that with these fractions?\n\n**Student:** Um, because they\u2019re both four? So it\u2019s like adding two apples and one apple?\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s a great analogy! They\u2019re both parts of the same whole. What would happen if the denominators were different, like 1/3 and 1/4?\n\n**Student:** Uh, I think I can just add the top numbers again, so it would be 2/7? \n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s a common mistake!

What do you think the bottom number, the denominator, means?\n\n**Student:** Maybe it\u2019s how many times you can count to three? \n\n**Educator:** Not quite! The denominator tells us how many equal parts the whole is divided into. Can you think of something we can divide into parts to visualize this better?\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 2: Comparing Fractions\n\n**Educator:** Hey! I see you\u2019re working on comparing fractions. What\u2019s been tricky for you?\n\n**Student:** I don\u2019t know. Sometimes I think 2/5 is bigger than 3/4, but I\u2019m not sure.\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s okay! Let\u2019s think about it together. What do you think it means for one fraction to be bigger than another?\n\n**Student:** I think it means the top number is bigger? Like, 3 is bigger than 2, so 3/4 is bigger than 2/5!\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s one way to look at it, but we also need to think about the whole! If we have a pizza divided into 4 slices and another pizza divided into 5 slices, which one do you think gives you bigger pieces?\n\n**Student:** Oh! I guess the 4 slices would be bigger pieces, so 3/4 would be bigger than 2/5!\n\n**Educator:** Exactly! So, if we compare them, can we say that 3/4 is indeed bigger than 2/5?\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 3: Adding Fractions with Like Denominators\n\n**Educator:** Hi! You\u2019re learning how to add fractions. What\u2019s been challenging for you?\n\n**Student:** I don\u2019t get why I can\u2019t just add the top numbers, like 1/4 plus 2/4 equals 3/4, right? \n\n**Educator:** You\u2019re on the right track with that! Adding the top numbers works well here. Can you tell me why we can do that with these fractions?\n\n**Student:** Um, because they\u2019re both four? So it\u2019s like adding two apples and one apple?\n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s a great analogy! They\u2019re both parts of the same whole. What would happen if the denominators were different, like 1/3 and 1/4?\n\n**Student:** Uh, I think I can just add the top numbers again, so it would be 2/7? \n\n**Educator:** That\u2019s a common mistake! We need to find a common denominator first before we can add them.
